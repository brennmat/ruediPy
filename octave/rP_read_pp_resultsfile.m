function X = rP_read_pp_resultsfile (file)

% function X = rP_read_pp_resultsfile (file)
% 
% Read and parse partial pressure data in ruediPy results file (see rP_calibrate_batch).
% 
% INPUT:
% file: name of results data file.
% 
% OUPUT:
% X: struct object with data from file. Stuct fields correspond to the header / columns in the results file.
%	- The first column is blindly assumed to be the sample name
%	- All other columns are assued to be EPOCHTIME/VALUE/ERROR triples
%	- Time/date is returned as UNIX epoch time, which can be converted to Matlab/Octave datenum format using the rP_epochtime2datenum (...) function.
