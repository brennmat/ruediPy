# ruediPy Octave code

This directory contains the Octave/MATLAB implementation of ruediPy.

The Octave code is currently supported and used by existing tools and workflows.
Python (`src/ruedipy`) is the primary target for new development, but the Octave
implementation is retained to ensure continuity, reproducibility, and
backwards compatibility.

The long-term relationship between the Octave and Python implementations
(e.g. coexistence, partial replacement, or deprecation) has not yet been
formally decided.
